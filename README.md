# Augustinas Markevicius

Always curious life hacker, ex-scientist and learning addict, passionate about swimming and climbing. I've created one of the smallest robots in the world and enabled a number of undergraduates to successfully complete their final year projects. Currently looking for a client focused and dynamic organisation where I could hone my Ruby and JavaScript programming skills and bring positive impact and long-term value.

## Coding Highlights

| [Lend & Tend](https://github.com/augustinas/lend_and_tend) | [Rate My Pothole](https://github.com/augustinas/rate-my-pothole) |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A user content-driven website that facilitates interaction between garden owners and people willing to garden in London area. | Experimental webapp to allow reporting of potholes around the UK. Has user upvoting system to identify potholes that matter to most to the public. |

## Skills

#### Teaching and Communication

Explaining complex ideas in a simple way is a great art that I've been practicing with students for the past 4 years. This experience will enable me to deliver technical solutions to clients easily.

I have:
- run tutorials for first year students for 2 semesters,
- taught in the teaching laboratory for 7 semesters,
- ran 3 final year undergraduate projects,
- delivered a number of scientific presentations (oral and posters) within the research group and for wider audiences in various conferences.

#### Innovative and Analytical

And what on earth do I mean by that? Well, a natural way for me to operate is to observe, create a hypothesis of how something works, and then test it. I come up with new ideas, solutions and improvements all the time.

- During my PhD I solved numerous problems on daily basis, and the best proof that I am good at this stuff is the completion of the PhD degree itself. My full list of publications can be seen on [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Augustinas_Markevicius).

- I developed with 4 successful project ideas that were given a team and financial resources. Two have been completed - we made the smallest knot out of a molecule and a tiny molecular robot capable of transporting cargoes (publication due soon). The other projects are still ongoing.

#### Initiator

I am a natural leader with a lot of initiative and am experienced in building teams towards a common goal. During my time at Makers I:

- convinced my fellow students to write a noob-friendly and up-to-date tutorial on RSpec testing. It served as a great learning experience to the authors, we produced a simple introduction to RSpec in two days and received a lot of positive feedback from coaches. It can be seen [here](https://github.com/augustinas/from-zero-to-hero-with-RSpec),
- gathered a team of 4 people to create RateMyPothole - pothole reporting app written in Sinatra (to be fair it desperately needs design makeover),
- showed leadership in a team of 8, which took the group from not having a plan of tackling a task to quickly and smoothly moving to a successful completion of the MVP within three days. It involved convincing team members to start with API design and then designing it.

#### Quality Code

I love writing code - clean, readable and efficient. Since learning about Agile, TDD and BDD processes at Makers, they sit at the heart of my coding philosophy. I speak fluent JavaScript and Ruby, good Java and enough Python to order a meal in a restaurant. More detailed list of technologies and skills:

- Object-Oriented Design, good control of SOLID and DRY principles
- Pair programming, master at doing it over Google Hangouts
- Test-driven development using following tools:
  - RSpec / Capybara / Cucumber / Selenium
  - Jasmine / Mocha / Karma / Protractor / PhantomJS
  - Gems for ActiveRecord: Shoulda / Rspec-activemodel-mocks / FactoryGirl
- Ruby / Rails / Sinatra
- JavaScript / JQuery / AngularJS / nodeJS / AJAX
- HTML5 / CSS3 / Bootstrap 3
- HAML / ERB / EJS / Markdown
- PostgreSQL / DataMapper / ActiveRecord / SQL / MongoDB
- User authentication with BCrypt / Devise / Omniauth (Facebook, Twitter, GitHub)
- APIs: Google Maps, Twitter, Facebook, Twilio

Great examples of what I can do with code can be seen on my [github profile](https://github.com/augustinas).
