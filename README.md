# Augustinas Markevicius

Always curious life hacker, ex-scientist and learning addict, passionate about swimming and climbing. I've created one of the smallest robots in the world and enabled a number of undergraduates to successfully complete their final year projects. Currently looking for a client focused and dynamic organisation where I could hone my Ruby and JavaScript programming skills and bring positive impact and long-term value.
